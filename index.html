            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Grace and I am a rising junior at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI studying
                Cognitive Science and Computer Science. At school, I'm involved in a few cultural orgs like Arab Business Society 
                and Arab Student Association as well as participated in research at my university.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of school, I enjoy spending time outside, traveling, watching Netflix, and have been getting 
                into crocheting my own tops. My favorite place I have traveled to is Italy because of the gorgeous views and food that
                always slaps.
